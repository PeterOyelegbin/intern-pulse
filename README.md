# Backend Individual Task 1 (Building a Simple User Registration API)
You're working as a backend developer intern at a growing startup called "Fitnessify." They offer a mobile fitness app that currently requires manual user registration through their website. This process is slow and lacks real-time feedback. They need a more efficient and automated solution.

## Goal:
Your task is to develop a backend API for user registration using a chosen backend technology (e.g., Python with Django or Flask, Node.js with Express). This API will handle user registration requests from the mobile app and securely store user data.

## Requirements:
* User Registration: The API should accept user information (username, email, password) through a secure POST request (e.g., JSON format).
* Data Validation: Implement validation checks on user input to ensure email format, password strength, and username availability.
* Secure Password Storage: Never store passwords in plain text. Use a hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) to securely store user passwords.
* Database Integration: Choose a suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user data and integrate it with your backend code.
* Error Handling: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages to the mobile app in case of failed registrations.
* API Documentation: Generate basic API documentation to explain the endpoints and expected data formats for the mobile app developers.

## Deliverables:
* Functional backend code written in your chosen language (e.g., Python script with Flask or Django framework).
* Integration with a chosen database to store user data securely.
* Unit tests for your backend API functionalities (highly encouraged).
* Basic API documentation.

## Resources:
* Choose a backend framework that you're comfortable with (e.g., Flask, Django, Express).
* Explore database management systems suitable for your project (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB).
* Look for online tutorials and documentation for secure password hashing and user authentication.

## Deployment:
Deploy on PythonAnywhere or any other free or paid platform you know!
